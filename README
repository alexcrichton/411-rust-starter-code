===========

This compiler is a Cargo crate, and should be built as such with `cargo build`
or it can be run with `cargo run path/to/input.l1`. You can pass additional
flags with `cargo run path/to/input.l1 -- --your-flag`.

The crate is broken up into the following files/directories:
- src/main.rs   Toplevel runtime for the compiler
- src/parse/    AST and PEG parser
- src/types     Typechecker
- src/ir/       IR language and translator
- src/codegen/  Assembly representation and code generation
- src/util/     Various utilities used across parts of the code
